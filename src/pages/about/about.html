        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Association was founded in January 1948 at the Imperial College, London, on the initiative of the Imperial College Vacation Work Committee.  National Organisations from ten European countries attended this meeting and became Members and Mr. James Newby was elected General Secretary. The geographical coverage soon spread to most of Europe and beyond, as new countries were granted membership. The Association became a registered body according to Luxembourg law at its General Conference 2005 in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The aim of creating association was to integrate and promote international understanding after Second World War. In 2018 we are celebrating 70th anniversary of IAESTE.</p>

        <h3>National anthem</h3>
        <p>The lyrics were written in 1797, two years after the Third Partition of Poland. It was originally meant to boost the morale of Polish soldiers. "Dabrowski's Mazurka" expressed the idea that the nation of Poland, despite lack of independence, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people were still alive and fighting in its name.</p>

            Poland has not yet perished,<br>
            So long as we still live.<br>
            What the alien force has taken from us,<br>
            We shall retrieve with a sabre.

            We shall rejoin the nation.

          <p>
            We'll cross the Vistula, we'll cross the Warta,<br>

            Bonaparte has given us the example<br>

        <h3>History of Poland</h3>
        <p>A long time ago three Slav brothers: Lech, Czech and Rus were wandering with their tribes across the lands of Poland. They were searching for the perfect place to stay. One day they saw an enormous oak tree. Furthermore, a huge white eagle was soaring into the sky. Brothers were amazed by the view and decided to settle in this area. They build a city called "Gniezno", which was the very first capital city of Poland.</p>
