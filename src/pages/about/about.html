        <p>The Island of Krk is located in the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, in the Kvarner Bay. It is the biggest island in Croatia with area of 409,9 square kilometers. It is also worth mentioning that the Island of Krk is one of the sunniest parts of Europe, with no less than 2500 sunny hours in the year.Due to its very favorable position and unique natural beauties, the Island of Krk was recognized as a very interesting tourist destination already in the 19th century. Nowadays, tourism is the backbone of Krk economy and the number of tourists is increasing annually.</p>
        <p>Successfully implemented initiatives for sustainable development and environmental protection, energetics, agriculture, tourism and entrepreneurship have, in large part, contributed to the sustainability and development of this area. This is one of the reasons why Krk is one of the rare Croatian islands that is fueled by population growth and holds the title "the Golden Island".</p>
        <p>On the island of Krk, precisely in the church of St. Lucy near Baška, Baška tablet was found, our most significant monument written in first Croatian alphabet, the glagolitic script.</p>
        <p>The emblem of city of Krk is a scops owl. In ancient times Krk was called Veglia. One scholar found a meaning of the word in Latin term vigilia, meaning wake, guard, vigilance which perfectly depicts the city of Krk. That is why a scops owl, which is awake during the night, was chosen to be on the emblem of city of Krk.</p>
