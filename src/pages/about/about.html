        <h3>History of Poland</h3>
        <p>A long time ago three Slav brothers: Lech, Czech and Rus were wandering with their tribes across the lands of Poland. They were searching for the perfect place to stay. One day they saw an enormous oak tree. Furthermore, a huge white eagle was soaring into the sky. Brothers were amazed by the view and decided to settle in this area. They build a city called "Gniezno", which was the very first capital city of Poland.</p>
