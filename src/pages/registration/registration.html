        <h1>Registration process</h1>
        <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are about to register to get the opportunity to attend the next <strong>CEC in Wadowice</strong>. IAESTE Poland members are giving their best to let the next CEC be remembered in the best ways. IAESTE stands also for diversity, therefore the registration system will be as following:</p>
        <p>In case there will be more than 200 registered people, CEC organizers will set the limit for number of participants per country. CEC organizers will send a list of participants to the National Secretaries with the limits per country. NS will be responsible for selecting a limited number of participants from their countries and sending us a list of the chosen participants. Based on this, payment information will be sent by the CEC organizers to NS.</p>
        <p>Maximum number of participants per country will be set through quantum arithmetic formula that the CER countries agreed on.</p>

        <p>The number of reserved places based on the Membership status of the Member:</p>
